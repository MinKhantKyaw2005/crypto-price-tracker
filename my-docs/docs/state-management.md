## Why React Query?

- **Efficient Data Fetching**: React Query simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- **Automatic Refetching**: It automatically refetches data when the app comes back online or the window is refocused.
- **DevTools**: React Query provides built-in DevTools for debugging.

## Why Zustand?

- **Lightweight**: Zustand is a minimal state management library with a simple API.
- **Flexible**: It allows you to manage both global and local state efficiently.
- **Performance**: Zustand avoids unnecessary re-renders, improving app performance.

## Why Context API?

- **Built-in**: No need for additional libraries.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to set up for small to medium-sized apps.
- **Scalability**: Works well with React's ecosystem.
